# Stream Processing with Apache Spark Book Examples

This repository contains Java implementations of the code examples from the book
"Stream Processing with Apache Spark" (originally written in Scala).

### About this Project

While studying the book, I converted most of the examples from Scala to Java to:

- Better understand Spark's streaming concepts
- Provide Java alternatives for developers who prefer Java to Scala
- Help others who might need Java implementations of these examples

### Who Might Find This Useful

- Java developers learning Spark Streaming
- Readers of the book who prefer Java implementations
- Anyone looking for practical Spark Streaming examples in Java

Feel free to use and contribute for any improvements!
